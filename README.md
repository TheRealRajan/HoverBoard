# HoverBoard
### A HoverBoard that will light up with different colors and leave a trail as you hover over the cells on the board with you mouse.
When you hover your mouse over an individual cell, it will light up with a random color to create a trailing effect which will eventually fade away. <br><br>
The demo is live at **https://therealrajan.github.io/HoverBoard/** <br>
